def reduce_metrics(metrics: dict[str, list[Any]]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Reduces a dictionary of metric lists by computing the mean, max, or min of each list.
    The reduce operation is determined by the key name:
    - If the key contains "max", np.max is used
    - If the key contains "min", np.min is used
    - Otherwise, np.mean is used

    Args:
        metrics: A dictionary mapping metric names to lists of metric values.

    Returns:
        A dictionary with the same keys but with each list replaced by its reduced value.

    Example:
        >>> metrics = {
        ...     "loss": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
        ...     "accuracy": [0.8, 0.9, 0.7],
        ...     "max_reward": [5.0, 8.0, 6.0],
        ...     "min_error": [0.1, 0.05, 0.2]
        ... }
        >>> reduce_metrics(metrics)
        {"loss": 2.0, "accuracy": 0.8, "max_reward": 8.0, "min_error": 0.05}
